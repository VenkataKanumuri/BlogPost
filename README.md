A Strategy for Improving Student Knowledge Acquisition using Concept Maps


Research has proven that students with a collaborative approach tend to acquire more knowledge than students without this approach. As they say, ”Collaboration allows us to know more than we are capable of knowing by ourselves”. Our project aims to evaluate how students enhance their knowledge acquisition when collaborating and using hybrid techniques like concept maps with agile methodology. Students or researchers these days can effectively search for any core topic with proper keywords in the available search engines and conveniently select related web pages to understand or study that core topic; however, condensing or structuring the retrieved information remains a difficult task for them. Concept mapping is an effective Knowledge construction method that helps learners organise critical concepts related to a core topic and represents the interrelationships among key concepts in an integrated, hierarchical manner. Concept mapping allows students or teachers to evaluate learning, enhance teaching or facilitate planning.Concept maps also effectively identify both valid and invalid ideas held by learners. Now when we are combing the concept map techniques with collaborative learning like, Computer-supported collaborative concept mapping takes advantage of technology and concept mapping to support conceptual understanding, as well as collaborative learning to foster knowledge co-construction and helps learners significantly in the higher ordering of integration and conflict-oriented agreement building. We, therefore, introduce a learning pattern of design, implement, analyse mistakes, review with peers and re-implement your thought process or writings with the help of concept maps into students’ daily cycles

RESULTS AND FEEDBACK:

To test and evaluate our methodology, we took feedback from 42 participants. Our participants were users of current online teaching systems. These participants had very basic or moderate understandings of the concepts mentioned in our blog post. Participants had to either answer it on a Likert scale of 1 to 5 or choose from the options. We observed that most participants found the classroom environment not so collaborative and blog environment or digital learning to be more productive. When questioned about the blogging methodology, 73.2% of the users felt that it has helped them enhance their knowledge acquisition. The concept map technique helped 78.5% of the users clarify their doubts or misconceptions better with the agile process interactions. 71.4% of the users found the structuring of the topics very useful in finding the related. topics. 57.1%of users understood the topics better after reading the blog posts.
